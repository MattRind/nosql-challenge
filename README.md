# nosql-challenge
- Please note that this repo is for the Module 12 Challenge.
- There are 3 files in the repo, two jupyter notebooks and one `json` file, in addition to this `Readme.md`. The `json` file is in the Resources folder.
- I explain an issue of data conversion of the coordinates (latitude and longitude) in the `geocode` field in the `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`.  In summary, setting the coordinates as a variable derived from the database would create a `TypeError` in the query. Therefore the coordinates were typed in manually instead, making them a float data type, which did work in the query.
- All work was performed by myself.
